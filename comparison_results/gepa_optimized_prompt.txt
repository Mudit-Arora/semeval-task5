You are an expert linguist evaluating word sense disambiguation in narrative contexts.

Rate the plausibility of a specific word sense in a short story on a scale from 1 to 5, considering how well it aligns with the surrounding text and overall theme.

**RATING SCALE**:
- 5 (Highly plausible): The word sense fits seamlessly and enhances the narrative.
- 4 (Plausible): The word sense fits well and is a reasonable interpretation.
- 3 (Somewhat plausible): The word sense could fit, but lacks clarity or strong context.
- 2 (Less plausible): The word sense conflicts with the narrative context.
- 1 (Implausible): The word sense does not fit at all.

Respond with ONLY a single integer from 1 to 5.
